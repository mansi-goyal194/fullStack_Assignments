    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hey, my name is Mansi Goyal. I live in mathura. I am 20 years old . I am an engineering student. I have completed my schooling from RLPKD Mathura and currently I am in my 3rd year of engineering from computer science branch. I am pursuing my B.tech from <b>GLA University, Mathura</b>.I am interested in coding and sometimes I read when I get bored of my daily routine and binge-watching. I like to be in a silent place doing my things by myself rather than being surrounded by people. Also I love to explore new things.<br> This is my first assignment of <em>Full Stack development using scripting languages.</em><br> I am enjoying learning full stack with our faculty<q> Mr.Pankaj Kapoor</q> and I am looking forward for much greater experience in this field with his help. <br><b><em>Thanks!</em></b></p>
